# Rosette-Example-Usage

I tried using each of the types of solver aided queries and was not successful with all of them, but I learned some things about Rosette.

### Failed Attempt

I also tried to make a program that would simplify any simple arithmatic expression into the form `(a/b) x + c`, but I learned that Rosette throws errors if you try to add multiple holes in an expression (ex. `(/ (??) (??))`. 

I tried the following forms to see if it was an issue with the order or using two holes in a binary expression but none worked. I also looked up the error it threw online, and all I could find was a stackoverflow thread about the same error being thrown when there were unnecessary partheneses which didnt apply to this issue. I also tried using rational numbers rather than an `a/b` term and it threw an error about needing a solvable type.
  ```
  (+ (/ (* x (??)) (??)) (??))
  (+ (* x (/ (??) (??))) (??))
  (+ (* x (??) (/ 1 (??))) (??)))
  ```

## Verify

I tried getting verify to output a useful binding, but it seems to require you to access the verification condition (the Rosette structure that stores the values of all assertions). I tried using it like `solve` to try to output bindings for a counterexample, but it only outputted an empty model.
